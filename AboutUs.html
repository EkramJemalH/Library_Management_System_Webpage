    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      BookNest started as a small project designed to solve a very common challenge:
      making library resources accessible and easy to manage for both librarians
      and readers. We realized that traditional library systems were often complicated,
      outdated, and intimidating for users. Our goal was to create a digital platform
      that feels simple and welcoming, just like a cozy nest filled with books. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past months, BookNest has grown into a complete library management solution
      that balances functionality with user-friendliness. Whether you are an administrator 
      keeping track of thousands of books or a reader searching for your next favorite novel, 
      BookNest is designed to make your experience smooth and enjoyable.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At BookNest, our mission is to empower libraries, schools, and communities by 
      providing a platform that makes knowledge more accessible. We believe that 
      reading is not just a hobby but a way to expand minds, share cultures, and 
      create opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to delivering a system that is reliable, secure, and adaptable
      to different institutions. From managing book inventories to supporting 
      members with easy borrowing and returning, our mission is to ensure that 
      libraries remain at the heart of learning and growth in every community.
